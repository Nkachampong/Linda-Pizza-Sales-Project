# Linda-Pizza-Sales-Project

**Analysing the Sales of Linda Pizza to provide recommendations for opening its new branches.**

**Background**

Linda Pizza is a pizza-making company with different types of pizza made in different sizes.
Due to their customers' higher demand for pizza, they have decided to open new 
branches to meet their customer demand. Because of this, they requested the supply of pizza 
ingredients from a pizza ingredient supply company called Dford to supply them pizza 
ingredients on credit and pay after sales. 
The database Pizza_Sale of Linda Pizza was provided to organize and analyse the following task:

1. How many Pizza types contain cheese
2. How many Pizza types contain tomatoes
3. How many Pizza types contain bacon
4. Create a visual to show the highest 10 Pizza Id ordered
5. Create a visual to show the average price of each pizza size
6. Create a visual to show the average price of each Pizza type regardless of their size
7. Create a visual to show what Pizza is the most expensive in general
8. Create a dashboard for the visuals created in 4,5,6,7
9. According to the trend of their sales, what 
recommendation should be given as a guide in partnering with Linda 
Pizza?
